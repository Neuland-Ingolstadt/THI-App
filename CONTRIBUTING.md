# How to contribute

The neuland.app is developed completely in JavaScript. We are using Next.js, which is a full-stack framework for developing web applications. This guide is supposed to give you a quick introduction into contributing your own changes.

## Required knowledge

You should know how to program in object oriented languages. Prior experience with JavaScript, React, HTML and CSS is helpful.

## Preparing your computer

You need to install the necessary tools.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js 18 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [ESLint for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Setting up the environment

Make a personal copy of the source code using the _Fork_ button on the top right of this page.

Open a terminal (e.g. PowerShell if you're on Windows) and download the source code to your PC using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/THI-App.git
cd THI-App/rogue-thi-app
```

Download everything else that is required to run the app:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

> **Note**
> For node.js versions 17 and above, you need to set the environment variable `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` to avoid an error when installing the dependencies.

Now open the `rogue-thi-app` folder in Visual Studio Code.

## Developing

Start the application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Go to [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) in your browser and voil√†, you're ready to go. You can change things in your code and your browser will automatically load the new version.

### Structure of the code

A quick overview over the structure of the source code:

- `/pages`  
  The pages of the application that you see in your browser. This is where to look if you want to change the structure of the UI.
- `/components`  
  Various reusable UI components such as the navigation and tab bar. Look here if a page references a custom component.
- `/styles`  
  CSS files describing the look of the application. Look here if you want to change the design of the UI.
- `/lib`  
  Various reusable utilities such as a client for the THI API and a timestamp formatter.
